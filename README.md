# CV-Project

The purpose of this project is to build a CV/Resume building application using React as a framework and utilizing React's original methodology of class components.

## Description

As recommended in React's documentation, state is held in the highest most point of the heirarchial component tree.

Components are built utilizing the class based methodology. The one page applicaton, feels like a multiple page website, due to the stepping through process which is built from switch statements.
