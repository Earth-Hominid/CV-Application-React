# Resume-Builder | React Class Components

The purpose of this project is to build a CV/Resume building application using React as a framework and utilizing React class components.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to practice using React's original methodology of class components. Class components are found in a high percentage of React applications, thus it is extremely important to obtain practical experience coding them.

In version 1.0 of this project, all components are built utilizing the class based methodology.

As recommended in React's documentation, state is held in the highest most point of the heirarchial component tree.

Switch statements were utilized to build a "stepping through process", which provides this one page application the feel of multiple pages.
